      <p>
        The World Diamond Council created a System of Warranties for diamonds
        that has been endorsed by all KPCS participants. Under this system,
        Marathon Company includes the following affirmative statement on all
        invoices:
      </p>
      <p>
        “The diamonds herein invoiced have been purchased from legitimate
        sources not involved in funding conflict and in compliance with United
        Nations resolutions. The seller hereby guarantees that these diamonds
        are conflict free, based on personal knowledge and/or written guarantees
        provided by the supplier of these diamonds.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It is considered a violation of the KPCS to issue a warranty declaration
        on a sales invoice unless it can be corroborated by warranty invoices
        received for purchases. Each company trading in diamonds must also keep
        records of the warranty invoices received and the warranty invoices
        issued when buying or selling diamonds. This flow of warranties in and
        out must be audited and reconciled on an annual basis by the company's
        auditors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the diamond industry organizations and their members have
        adopted the following principles of self-regulation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          to trade only with companies that include warranty declarations on
          their invoices;
        </li>
        <li>
          to not buy diamonds from suspect sources or unknown suppliers, or
          which originate in countries that have not implemented the Kimberley
          Process Certification Scheme;
        </li>
        <li>
          to not buy diamonds from any sources that, after a legally binding due
          process system, have been found to have violated government
          regulations restricting the trade in conflict diamonds;
        </li>
        <li>
          to not buy diamonds in or from any region that is subject to an
          advisory by a governmental authority indicating that conflict diamonds
          are emanating from or available for sale in such region, unless
          diamonds have been exported from such region in compliance with the
          Kimberley Process Certification Scheme;
        </li>
        <li>
          to not knowingly buy or sell or assist others to buy or sell conflict
          diamonds;
        </li>
        <li>
          to ensure that all company employees that buy or sell diamonds within
          the diamond trade are well informed regarding trade resolutions and
          government regulations restricting the trade in conflict diamonds.

    <q-expansion-item group="group" label="Dodd Frank Act">
      <p>
        In 2010, a new law was enacted, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
        Consumer Protection Act. Within the Act, there is a provision regarding
        so-called “Conflict Minerals” (Tin, Tungsten, Tantalum and Gold)
        requiring U.S. based public companies to disclose measures they have
        taken to identify these metals within their supply chains and to
        demonstrate that they have not been sourced either directly or
        indirectly from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DCR) and adjoining
        nations. It is the policy of the Marathon Company to be compliant with
        the requirements of this provision of the Dodd-Frank Act and require our
        supply chain to assure compliance as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is our policy that we do not use any metals in our products that come
        from conflict areas as outlined in the Dodd-Frank Act. We only partner
        with suppliers who are in compliance with this Act and can provide
        evidence of compliance.

    <q-expansion-item group="group" label="Code of Conduct">
      <h5>Bribery</h5>
      <p>
        We are committed to a working and business environment free of bribery
        and facilitation payments that are both seen as a form of corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bribes are paid to obtain something the bribe receiver would not
        otherwise have provided. Bribes may take the form of cash, gifts in
        kind, hospitality, expenses, advantage or promises. Facilitation
        payments are paid to receive preferential treatment for something that
        the payment receiver is otherwise still required to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marathon is committed to not offer, accept or countenance the payment of
        bribes in any form and we consider bribery risk on the general practices
        of our ongoing business. We encourage the reporting of incidents of
        attempted bribery and communicate that no employees shall suffer adverse
        consequences by voicing concerns or refusing to pay a bribe. Marathon
        currently has financial accounting instruments in place to monitor
        facilitation payments and other forms of potential bribery.
      </p>
      <h5>Whistleblower Protection</h5>
      <p>
        Marathon adheres to federal statutes regarding whistleblower protection
        stating that an employer may not discharge or otherwise retaliate
        against an employee because the employee has filed a complaint or
        exercised any rights provided to employees
      </p>
      <h5>Competition</h5>
      <p>
        We are dedicated to ethical, fair and vigorous competition. We will sell
        Marathon's products based on their merit, superior quality,
        functionality and competitive pricing. We will make independent pricing
        and marketing decisions and will not improperly cooperate or coordinate
        our activities with our competitors. We will not offer or solicit
        improper payments or gratuities in connection with the purchase of goods
        or services for Marathon or the sales of its products or services, nor
        will we engage or assist in unlawful boycotts of particular customers.
