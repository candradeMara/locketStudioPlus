TODO: 
orders table filtering/search

CARLOS:
/products/{sku}
  change related_products field to just array of skus ["sku", "sku", ...]
  no longer need to include collection_label and category_label for each product.
  engraving.engraveCode is wrong for some products like dl150 = 'ge17p` instead of `ye17p`...

/app/default
store collections and categories
collections: {
  adult: {
    label: "Adult Essentials",
    path: "/adult",
    children: {
      bracelets: {
        label: "Bracelets", path: "/adult/bracelets/"
      },
      {...}
    }
  },
  {...}
}

/app/newItems
I've setup an admin UI to handle the "what's new" products. 
items: ["sku", "sku", ...]

/accounts/{accountId}
Addresses no longer need to be stored for each user, but just for the account doc.
addresses: [{city: "", line1: "", line2: "", name: "", state: "", zipcode: 12345}, {...}]

Kye
DE and DL products are jpg not png.
Please upload lead tests to imagekit


Me:
1. Check user update cloud function... especially "can we change email addresses"?

Known Issues:
1. Orders sorting/searching is currently broken.
2. Email Templates are being created.
4. Tradeshow Add To Calendar Function needs reimplemented. (Just can't add time)


What data to include for order history
What data to include for ordered doc?
Make separate document for 'shipped'?
  - Favorites only allows sort by added and by sku...

store account.shipped_items: [sku,sku,sku] just for checking if downloads allowed.

store account/ordered/items: sku: {sku: 'sku',name: 'Name', recent_order_time: TIMESTAMP, shipped: true, collection: 'col', category: 'cat', quantity: 3}

Carlos can just do collection queries for orders and user using created_at...

Carlos: deleted_users are now stored...
